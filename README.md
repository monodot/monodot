### Hi there 👋 - it's me, Tom

I'm a developer and DevOps engineer type of person. I work at Grafana Labs. 

🔭 In my free time I'm also working on:

- 🌍 My blogs: [tomd.xyz][tomd] and [Tutorial Works][tw]
- [Live Curtain][lc], a message displayer and countdown clock for your online meetings
- [Apoll.app][apoll], a way to create and share super-simple, anonymous, expiring polls

🤔 I'm interested in:

- Writing and creating stuff!
- Integration and messaging - Apache Camel and ActiveMQ. I've written a book on Apache Camel for beginners, which is called [Apache Camel Step-by-Step][camelsbs].
- DevOps practice and technology: Containers, Kubernetes/OpenShift, CI/CD
- Biscuits, especially digestives, bourbon and hobnobs.

📫 Want to know anything else? Feel free to knock on my door [on Twitter][twitter] or [on LinkedIn][linkedin].
