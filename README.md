### Hi there 👋 - it's me, Tom

I'm a Field Engineer at Grafana Labs where I specialise in helping customers observe their entire stack.

🔭 I also like to work on side projects. In my free time, I'm also working on:

- 🌍 My blogs and websites: [tomd.xyz][tomd] and [Tutorial Works][tw]
- [Live Curtain][lc], a message displayer and countdown clock for your online meetings
- [Apoll.app][apoll], a way to create and share super-simple, anonymous, expiring polls

🤔 I'm interested in:

- Writing and creating stuff, and building websites.
- DevOps technology and practices: Containers, Kubernetes/OpenShift, CI/CD
- Integration and messaging - Apache Camel and ActiveMQ. I've written a book on Apache Camel for beginners, which is called [Apache Camel Step-by-Step][camelsbs].
- Biscuits (especially digestives, bourbon and hobnobs).
