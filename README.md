### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - it's me, Tom

I'm a Field Engineer at Grafana Labs where I specialise in helping customers observe their entire stack.

ðŸ”­ I also like to work on side projects. In my free time, I'm also working on:

- [Tutorial Works][tw] - a tech blog and library of tutorials for cloud and software engineers working with technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Java and more. I also publish code samples to the [tutorialworks GitHub organisation][tworg].

ðŸ¤” I'm interested in:

- Writing and creating stuff, and building websites.
- DevOps technology and practices: Containers, Kubernetes/OpenShift, CI/CD
- Integration and messaging - Apache Camel and ActiveMQ. I've written a book on Apache Camel for beginners, which is called [Apache Camel Step-by-Step][camelsbs].
- Biscuits (especially digestives, bourbon and hobnobs).

I have a couple of dormant projects:

- [Live Curtain][lc], a message displayer and countdown clock for your online meetings
- [Apoll.app][apoll], a way to create and share super-simple, anonymous, expiring polls

ðŸ“« Want to know anything else? Feel free to knock on my door [on Twitter][twitter] or [on LinkedIn][linkedin].
