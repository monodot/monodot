### Hi there 👋 - it's me, Tom

I'm a Field Engineer at Grafana Labs, where I help people observe more from their stack 🕵️‍♂️.

🤔 I'm interested in:

- Teaching and writing about technology
- DevOps technology and practices: Containers, Kubernetes, CI/CD, infrastructure automation.
- Integration and messaging - e.g. with Apache Camel and ActiveMQ. I wrote a book about Apache Camel for beginners, called [Apache Camel Step-by-Step][camelsbs].
- Biscuits (especially digestives, bourbon and hobnobs).
