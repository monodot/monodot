### Hi there 👋 - it's me, Tom

I'm a Field Engineer at Grafana Labs, where I help people observe more from their stack 🕵️‍♂️.

🔭 I also like to work on side projects. In my free time, I'm also working on:

- [Tutorial Works][tw] - a tech blog and library of tutorials for cloud and software engineers working with technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Java and more. I also publish code samples to the [tutorialworks GitHub organisation][tworg].
- [Live Curtain][lc], a message displayer and countdown clock for your online meetings
- [Apoll.app][apoll], a way to create and share super-simple, anonymous, expiring polls

🤔 I'm interested in:

- Teaching and writing about technology
- DevOps technology and practices: Containers, Kubernetes, CI/CD, infrastructure automation.
- Integration and messaging - e.g. with Apache Camel and ActiveMQ. I wrote a book about Apache Camel for beginners, called [Apache Camel Step-by-Step][camelsbs].
- Biscuits (especially digestives, bourbon and hobnobs).
